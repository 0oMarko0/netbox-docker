      # Time for which the health check can fail after the container is started.
      # This depends mostly on the performance of your database. On the first start,
      # when all tables need to be created the start_period should be higher than on
      # subsequent starts. For the first start after major version upgrades of NetBox
      # the start_period might also need to be set higher.
      # Default value in our docker-compose.yml is 60s
      start_period: 90s
